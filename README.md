However, you may use any Backend framework or language you like with this project.

## Install

```sh
# Requires node 16.x or higher
npm install

```

For production, run `npm run build`, then follow official Vite guide
on [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html), depending on your hosting of choice.
