(Frontend Repo). Clone of Udemy, PWA (progressive web app) built using Vue 3, Vite, Typescript, Pinia, and Element Plus.
At checkout, payments are securely handled by **Braintree Payments** (owned by PayPal), which also supports cards, Apple
Pay, GooglePay, Venmo and many other methods. This project implements Credit-Card and PayPal Checkout only. This is the
Student-facing web app -- does NOT include Instructor or Admin panel. Users may log in with either email/password or
with Google.

## Backend Repo

The backend for the Demo is a separate Java Springboot
application [available here](https://github.com/Longwater1234/WedemyServer) with API Docs. However, you may use any
server framework or language you like with this project.

## Install

```sh
# Requires node 16.x or higher
npm install
```

## Usage

In local development, the app runs on port 5173 by default. You can change it in [vite.config.ts](vite.config.ts).
Create an `.env` file at project root directory and fill in appropriate values (see `.env.sample`).

```sh
npm run dev
```

For production, run `npm run build`, then follow official Vite guide
on [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html), depending on your hosting of choice. Remember to set ENV
variables on your target Cloud platform.

## [Live Demo](https://wedemy.up.railway.app/)

PLEASE READ: The Demo uses Sandbox (Dev) Mode of Braintree Payments. **No actual money will be deducted on Checkout**.
You **should** use test credit-card
numbers [listed here](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/guides/credit-cards/testing-go-live/java). Also, this
Demo serves embedded video from YouTube (just for simplicity).
